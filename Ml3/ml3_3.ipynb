    "\n",
    "- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression:** OLS aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals to find the best-fitting line that predicts the dependent variable. It doesn't include any penalty terms on the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression:** Ridge Regression is a regularization technique that extends OLS by adding a penalty term to the coefficients. This penalty term (L2 regularization) is proportional to the square of the coefficients, encouraging smaller coefficient values and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n"

    "2. Independence of Errors: The residuals are independent and have constant variance.\n",

    "\n",
    "The tuning parameter, often denoted as lambda (Î»), controls the strength of regularization in Ridge Regression. The value of lambda needs to be chosen through techniques like cross-validation. A range of lambda values is tried, and the one that provides the best balance between bias and variance (minimizing both training error and overfitting) is selected.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression doesn't perform feature selection in the same way as some other techniques like Lasso Regression. It tends to shrink all coefficients towards zero without making them exactly zero. While it can reduce the impact of less important features, it doesn't inherently lead to feature selection like Lasso does.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression helps mitigate the issue of multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients. It reduces the impact of highly correlated features by distributing the effect across them. This can result in more stable and interpretable coefficients even in the presence of multicollinearity.\n"

For time-series data, specialized techniques like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) or other time-series models might be more appropriate due to the temporal dependency of observations.\n",
