    "**Q1. Lasso Regression and Differences from Other Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression is a regularization technique used in linear regression models. It adds a penalty term (L1 regularization) to the loss function, which encourages coefficients to become exactly zero. This makes Lasso useful for both prediction and feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, Lasso stands out by automatically performing feature selection and producing sparse models by driving some coefficients to zero.\n"

    "\n",
    "The main advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can effectively eliminate less important features by setting their coefficients to zero. This results in simpler, more interpretable models and can help prevent overfitting by focusing on the most relevant variables.\n"

    "**Q3. Interpretation of Lasso Regression Coefficients:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients in Lasso Regression, just like in linear regression, represent the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the corresponding independent variable. Coefficients that are not set to zero indicate the importance and direction of the relationship between each feature and the response variable.\n"

    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression has a tuning parameter, often denoted as lambda (Î»), which controls the strength of the regularization. Smaller values of lambda lead to less regularization, while larger values lead to stronger regularization. Another parameter is the alpha value, which determines the balance between L1 and L2 regularization.\n"

    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression itself is designed for linear models. However, you can extend it to non-linear problems by introducing non-linear transformations of the features, using polynomial features, or incorporating other techniques like kernel methods. For inherently non-linear problems, other regression techniques might be more appropriate.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression adds an L2 regularization term (squared coefficients) to the loss function, while Lasso Regression adds an L1 regularization term (absolute coefficients). Lasso can drive coefficients exactly to zero, performing feature selection, while Ridge only shrinks coefficients towards zero. This makes Lasso more suitable for sparse models and feature selection.\n"

    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression handles multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients, effectively reducing the impact of correlated features. It might select one of the correlated features while driving others to zero. However, Lasso can also be sensitive to the specific set of features and may not consistently select the same features in the presence of multicollinearity.\n"

    "\n",
    "The optimal value of lambda can be chosen using techniques like cross-validation. You can try a range of lambda values and evaluate the model's performance on validation data. The lambda value that minimizes prediction error while avoiding overfitting is usually chosen as the optimal value. Tools like cross-validated grid search help automate this process."
