    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches, including machine learning and deep learning. Example: Virtual personal assistants like Siri or Google Assistant, which can understand natural language and perform tasks based on user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. Example: Email spam filtering, where the model learns from past labeled data (spam vs. non-spam) to classify new emails as either spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning (DL): Deep Learning is a specialized field of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems. It involves processing data through multiple layers of neural networks to extract high-level features. Example: Image recognition tasks, where deep learning models can identify objects, people, or animals in images with high accuracy."

    "Examples of supervised learning:\n",
    "1. Image classification: Classifying images into different categories (e.g., dog vs. cat).\n",

Semi-supervised learning seeks to enhance the performance of supervised models by leveraging unlabeled data.\n",
