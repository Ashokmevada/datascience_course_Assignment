    "Q1. A Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It is an ensemble model that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to make accurate continuous (numeric) predictions. Each decision tree in the ensemble is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and they work together to provide a robust and generalized prediction of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms:\n",
    "   - **Bootstrap Sampling**: Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data with replacement (bootstrap sample). This introduces diversity among the trees and reduces the likelihood of overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "   - **Feature Randomness**: Random Forest introduces randomness in feature selection, considering only a subset of features at each split. This further reduces overfitting by limiting the depth and complexity of individual trees.\n",
    "   - **Averaging**: The predictions of multiple trees are averaged, smoothing out individual tree biases and reducing noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by taking the average (or mean) of the predictions made by each tree in the ensemble. In a regression task, the final prediction for a given input is the average of the predictions of all the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Some of the key hyperparameters of a Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "   - `n_estimators`: The number of decision trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "   - `max_depth`: The maximum depth of each decision tree.\n",
    "   - `min_samples_split`: The minimum number of samples required to split a node.\n",
    "   - `min_samples_leaf`: The minimum number of samples required to be in a leaf node.\n",
    "   - `max_features`: The number of features to consider for the best split at each node.\n",
    "   - `bootstrap`: Whether or not to use bootstrap sampling for training.\n",
    "   - `random_state`: A seed for random number generation to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The main differences between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are as follows:\n",
    "   - **Ensemble vs. Single Tree**: Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble model composed of multiple decision trees, whereas Decision Tree Regressor is a single decision tree.\n",
    "   - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Random Forest Regressor tends to have lower variance and reduced risk of overfitting compared to Decision Tree Regressor, which can easily overfit the data.\n",
    "   - **Predictions**: Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions from multiple trees by averaging, while Decision Tree Regressor's prediction is based on a single tree's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Advantages of Random Forest Regressor**:\n",
    "   - Reduced overfitting and improved generalization.\n",
    "   - Robust to noisy data.\n",
    "   - Handles both numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "   - Provides feature importances for feature selection.\n",
    "   - Suitable for high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "   - May require more computational resources due to multiple trees.\n",
    "   - Can be less interpretable compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numeric value, representing the predicted value for the target variable. It provides a prediction that is the average of predictions made by individual decision trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. While Random Forest is primarily used for regression tasks, it can also be adapted for classification tasks using the \"Random Forest Classifier.\" The main difference is in the type of prediction made:\n",
    "   - **Random Forest Regressor**: Predicts a continuous numeric value (e.g., predicting house prices).\n",
    "   - **Random Forest Classifier**: Predicts a categorical class label (e.g., classifying whether an email is spam or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying ensemble and hyperparameters are similar, but the output and loss functions differ between the regression and classification versions."
